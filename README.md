* [Assembling a Query Engine From Spare Parts](https://www.firebolt.io/content/firebolt-vldb-cdms-2022): This paper introduces how Firebolt database is assembled using different opensource components as stepping stones within 18 months. Specifically:
  1. they chose *Hyrise* as the foundation of its SQL parser and planner (we would recommend *DuckDB* or *Calcite* now).
  1. it chose a *vectorization* runtime: *ClickHouse*. They also implemented a new Firebolt distributed processing stack to replace the ClickHouse's stack.
  1. The storage engine uses a columnar data layout.
  1. For cross-network communication, it chose a custom *protobuf*-based serialization format (*Substrait* seems to be a better alternative now).  
  
    As a lesson learnt, they chose assembling on top of a solid foundation, building in a single language for high velocity, investing heavily to connect different systems, e.g. unifying the type systems across planner and runtime.
