* [Assembling a Query Engine From Spare Parts](https://www.firebolt.io/content/firebolt-vldb-cdms-2022) (2022): This paper introduces how Firebolt database is built within 18 months. It is decoupled into several components, and most of them are built on top of some existing opensource projects to save the dev efforts. Specifically:
  1. they chose *Hyrise* as the foundation of its SQL parser and planner (we would recommend *DuckDB* or *Calcite* now).
  1. it chose a *vectorization* runtime: *ClickHouse*. They also implemented a new Firebolt distributed processing stack to replace the ClickHouse's stack.
  1. The storage engine uses a columnar data layout.
  1. For cross-network communication, it chose a custom *protobuf*-based serialization format (*Substrait* seems to be a better alternative now).  
As a lesson learnt, they chose assembling on top of a solid foundation, building in a single language for high velocity, investing heavily to connect different systems, e.g. the parser and planner, the planner and runtime, the runtime and storage engine.
